The data consists of 22 Columns and 2938 rows which meant 20 predicting variables. All predicting variables were then divided into several broad categories:Immunization related factors, Mortality factors, Economical factors, and social factors.

Variable Descriptions
1.	Country (Nominal) - the country in which the indicators are from (i.e., United States of America or Congo)
2.	Year (Ordinal) - the calendar year the indicators are from (ranging from 2000 to 2015)
3.	Status (Nominal) - whether a country is 'Developing' or 'Developed' by WHO standards
4.	Life_expectancy (Ratio) - the life expectancy of people in years for a particular country and year
5.	Adult_mortality (Ratio) - the adult mortality rate per 1000 population (i.e., number of people dying between 15 and 60 years per 1000 population); if the rate is 263 then that means 263 people will die out of 1000 between the ages of 15 and 60; another way to think of this is that the chance an individual will die between 15 and 60 is 26.3%
6.	Infant_deaths (Ratio) - number of infant deaths per 1000 population; like above, but for infants
7.	Alcohol (Ratio) - a country's alcohol consumption rate measured as liters of pure alcohol consumption per capita
8.	Percentage_expenditure (Ratio) - expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
9.	Hepatitis_b (Ratio) - number of 1-year-olds with Hepatitis B immunization overall 1-year-olds in the population
10.	Measles (Ratio) - number of reported Measles cases per 1000 population
11.	BMI (Interval/Ordinal) - average Body Mass Index (BMI) of a country's total population
12.	Under-five_deaths (Ratio) - number of people under the age of five deaths per 1000 population
13.	Polio (Ratio) - number of 1-year-olds with Polio immunization over the number of all 1-year-olds in the population
14.	Total_expenditure (Ratio) - government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure
15.	Diphtheria (Ratio) - Diphtheria tetanus toxoid, pertussis (DTP3) immunization rate of 1-year-olds
16.	HIV/aids (Ratio) - deaths per 1000 live births caused by HIV/AIDS for people under 5; the number of people under 5 who die due to HIV/AIDS per 1000 births
17.	GDP (Ratio) - Gross Domestic Product per capita
18.	Population (Ratio) - population of a country
19.	Thinness_1-19_years (Ratio) – the rate of thinness among people aged 10-19 (Note: variable should be renamed to thinness_10-19_years to represent more accurately the variable)
20.	Thinness_5-9_years (Ratio) – the rate of thinness among people aged 5-9
21.	Income_composition_of_resources (Ratio) - Human Development Index in terms of income composition of resources (index ranging from 0 to 1)
22.	Schooling (Ratio) – the average number of years of schooling of a population
